# Development/Desktop Config
This is just a very basic, process based script I wrote to install apps/dev tools I use frequently.

Functions are divided as follows:
1. Add Desktop apps (noted below).
1. Remove Firefox, Totem, Thunderbird, and Rhythmbox.
1. Add Oracle JDK.
1. Install NetBeans 11.
1. Install Node.js
1. Setup a LAMP server.
1. Setup basic PHP Static analysis tools.
1. Perform system upgrades.

Each function is called in order, and can be invoked or skipped, as required.

Feel free to extend, implement, adjust as necessary, if you find this useful in any way.  I only ask that you include a credit to me in any modifications.  Thanks!

I will be adding a menu to a future version, as I have time.
